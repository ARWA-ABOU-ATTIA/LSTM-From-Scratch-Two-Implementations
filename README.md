# LSTM-From-Scratch-Two-Implementations
A comprehensive project exploring Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks through two distinct implementationsâ€”one using a simple numeric sequence and another using a text-based approach. This repository is designed for educational purposes and is fully integrated with Kaggle notebooks for hands-on experimentation.
